        <div id="goombatext">The Goomba is a member of Bowser's army and a weak one at that. Goombas can be killed with just 1 hit, in most games, usually by jumping. There are many different versions of the Goomba such as the flying ParaGoombas, Giant Goombas, Spiked Goombas, and Tanooki Goombas (they don Mario's famous Raccoon appearence). A different species of Goomba, the Galoomba, was introduced in Super Mario World. Goomba's are frequent enemy's of mine and Luigi who frequently stomp on them.</div>

        <div id="cheeptext">Cheep Cheeps (sometimes formatted as Cheep-Cheeps or Cheep-cheeps) are fish that made their first appearance in Super Mario Bros. in the underwater levels. They are common recurring enemies throughout my franchise. They are found mostly in the water but they can jump out of the water as well like in Mario Super Sluggers. There are many different species of Cheep Cheeps, and they come in different colors, including yellow and green.</div>

        <div id="bobombtext">Bob-ombs are living, moving mechanical bombs with eyes, feet, and a wind-up key on the back. They are generic enemies who first appeared in Super Mario Bros. 2 and have appeared in nearly every one of my games since then. Their appearance, intelligence, and status in relation to me differ widely from game to game. They are usually either blue or black, but some variations are pink or red. They also flash red and sometimes make beeping sounds if they are about to explode.</div>
