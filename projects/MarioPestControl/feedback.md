Way to push the boundries on styling and working on making it responsive.  This generally takes the longest to get a good grasp of, and you are doing well.

You do a great job with indentation and proper spacing.  Your code is clean and easy to read.

Work on your naming conventions to make them more descriptive and easier to understand for your classes and css tags.  
This will make the readability for others easier, and your own coding will be faster.

Impressive project.  Keep up the good work.
